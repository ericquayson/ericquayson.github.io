Journal Week 2 
===============

 
 My memory of the previous week is a bit blurry due to the overload of vanilla JavaScript. We focused on the functionality of a website which is the JavaScript. The functionality of JavaScript relies on capturing `DOM` nodes and doing something with them. Specifically, once the `DOM` element is captured, there can be events attributed to these elments so when a user clicks an element on the `DOM` this allows for the window to these pop an alert or takes the user to another page. Last week revealed that vanilla JavaScript is something I want to be a master of. I want to be able to write great code that works just as good as it would if I were using a library like jQuery. I know with more time and practice that my vanilla JavaScript skills will increase.
 
Bigger Picture Concept
======================

 Additionally, the concept of MVC was unearthed. MVC is a design practice that is a standard within the developing community. This allows for developer organize their code in an efficient manner. Specifically, MVC focus on the model, view, and controller.
 
     The model is the data that will be used. The model is always pure JavaScript. 
     The view deals with the representation of the data. The view most of the times is HTML.
     The controller deals with JavaScript manipulating the DOM.
     

This past weekend, I gave myself the challenge of trying to allocate more time to hardcore coding and really digging deep and pushing through even when there are moments when I want to give up. I've been staying up late and trying to push myself to stay focus and just become curious about everything. Moreover, playing around with flukeout(http://flukeout.github.io) and reworking assignments with new tools like browser-sync and jQuery. 


I'm feeling much better about my developing experience than I did when I first started at TIY. My mindset is soley focused on this and I will be a great developer. I realize speaking things into existence is the first step into the right direction. Overall, second week of the TIY experience allowed me to evaluate and realize what are some of my strong suits like "googling" and some of my weak spots like mapping out the logic behind the code I'm attempting to write. Luckily, I realize that it was only the second week and I have 10 more weeks to go to beef up my skills and become a JavaScript wizard.
