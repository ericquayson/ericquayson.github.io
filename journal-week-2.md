Journal Week 2 

 Outline
 
 My memory of the previous week is a bit blurry due to the overload of JavaScript. We focused on the functionality of a website which is the JavaScript. Additionally, the concept of MVC was unearthed. MVC is a design practice that is a standard within the developing community. This allows for developer organize their code in an efficient manner. Specifically, MVC focus on the model, view, and controller.
 
     The model is the data that will be used. The model is always pure JavaScript. 
     The view deals with the representation of the data. The view most of the times is HTML.
     The controller deals with JavaScript manipulating the DOM.
