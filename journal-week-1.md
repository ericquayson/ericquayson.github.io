### Journal Week - 1 Reflection

Developers have the ability to program your website in order to make it functional or make your website talk to a server. However, while doing my own research I realized that a role of a developer can take on multiple roles. Within the first week, I realized that it will be in my best interest to leverage my internation business skills with the technical know-how I will be learning and developing through this cohort. 


The first day of the second week of being back at the Iron Yard was insightful. It was revealed to me that I can do a better job on time management and simply following the directions that are laid out. My first week back at the Iron Yard I was told that I arrived late multiple times and did not complete any of the homework assignments. Although, this is true. I'm thankful that these simply mistakes can be corrected. 


The first week back at the Iron Yard, we covered the essentials concepts of understanding JavaScript. 

We covered the 4 primitiative types. 

We covered functions, arrays and objects. 

We covered that arrays have their own set of methods (or functions) that can help the developer extract the information within the list aka the array.

We covered Github.
