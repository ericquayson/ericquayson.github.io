### Journal Week - 1 Reflection

Journal Week - 1 Reflection

The first week back at the Iron Yard, we covered the essentials concepts of understanding JavaScript. These concepts range from the four primitive types; functions; arrays; objects. Specifically, arrays have their own set of methods (or functions) that can help the developer extract the information within the list aka the array (methods: push, pop, shift, unshift). Additionally, array methods are functions. I diligently took notes in order to make sure grasp all the concepts fully. These notes can be found in my TIY-Assignments. We covered Github extensively and currently still are. My understanding of Github is steadily increasing by the day.

However, school is not only about understanding the concepts, but having good time management practices in placed. The first day of the second week of being back at the Iron Yard was insightful. It was revealed to me that I could do a better job on time management. I'm thankful that something like time management can be easily corrected.

Developers have the ability to program your website in order to make it functional or make your website talk to a server. However, while doing my own research I realized that a role of a developer can take on multiple roles. Within the first week, I realized that it will be in my best interest to leverage my international business skills with the technical know-how I will be learning and developing through this cohort.
