Journal Week 5
===============



So... week 5 journal makes me feel a little Anne Frankish. I try to start to write it and flashbacks of javascript, chessboard and css kicking my ass immediately comes to my mind. Bad analogy? Oh well. However, most of my stress came from that devil of a chessboard. Unfortunately, my pieces did not move, however I will still be working on it. The chessboard encapsulated all of the concepts we have covered so far. I will be going back and reworking my board.
