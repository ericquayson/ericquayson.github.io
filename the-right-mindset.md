Many individuals are faced with the hardship of understanding new concepts. This task can be as daunting as skydiving. However, there has been a plethora of research that has taken a deep dive into the idea of 'growing the mind.' Social psychologist, Carol Dweck has coined the concept of the growth mindset.
In the initial stages of Dweck's research, she primarily focused on challenging adolescents with the task of trying to solve problems that were out of their level of education. This task engenders an interesting dichotomy amongst the youngsters. Moreover, the other 50% of the students were up to the challenge of working on something he or she had no prior knowledge of. However, unfortunately, this task left the other half of students feeling defeated because the level of complexity.
This initial trial helped Dweck create a list of characteristics that can be associated with the growth mindset. Specifically, these characteristics of cultivating a growth mindset range from less praises and a stronger focus on the iterative process that closely looks at the process, efforts, strategies and improvements. These characteristics are dimly practiced by public educational system. Additionally, Dweck's research has provided a pivotal tool to decreasing the racial achievement gap.
Lastly, the core of this concept is transforming ideologies around putting in effort and facing difficulty concepts into the feeling of being rewarded as the individual engages in the iterative process of growing the mind. To that end, intelligence can be developed.
