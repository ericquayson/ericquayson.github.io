### MVC and Chessboard
 Week 4 took the theories we have been covering and added a layer of real-world context. Specifically, the chessboard assignment introduced MVC in a more tangiable manner. Unfortunately, I did not finish my assignment or get parts of my code to work, I did enjoy doing the assignment. I've started to get more comfortable with CSS and SASS. Reflecting on my experience with node-sass is ALMOST comical. I thought I had a problem, but I really didn't. I need to pay attention to the relationships of some of the CSS properties to see how one affects the other. However, week four made me realize how much I enjoyed styling. My next challenge for myself is to create a project where I can create a skeleton webpage and have boxes on the page and explore CSS properties.I do feel as if I'm getting better as a front-end engineer. I've realized parts in my dev skillset that I want to improve on and I will.
