## Outline

### Pick 5 things to talk about

### MVC and Chessboard
+ Week 4 solidified theory and real-world context. Specifically, the chessboard assignment introduced MVC in a more tangiable 
+ manner. Unfortunately, I did not finish my assignment or get parts of my code to work, I did enjoy doing the assignment.  
+ Starting to get more comfortable with CSS and SASS 
+ Week 4 made me realize how much I enjoyed, but have so much more to learn about CSS. My next challenge for myself is to create + a project where I can create a skeleton webpage and have boxes on the page and explore CSS properties. 
### Talk about the trouble I had with compiling the files with node-sass
+ Reflecting on my experience with node-sass is ALMOST comical. I thought I had a problem, but I really didn't. End of story. 

+ I do feel as if I'm getting better as a front-end engineer. I've realized parts in my dev skillset that I want to improve on
+ and I will.
