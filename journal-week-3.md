Reading journals from Last week made me realize the power of brevity. 
With that being said, here is a quick run down of my CSS3 adventures from last week. In class, we focused mainly on learning
the ins and outs of CSS3. I learned the standard layout for defining a selector in CSS3. Moreover, there are some similarities to what the syntax and the structure of an object literal looks like. The contents of a selector definition houses the properities and values that will style the page.

As I started to do more and more research on CSS3, the box model was unearthed. The box model focuses on describing the layering of design and layout around the HTML content. The innermost layer of the box model is the content (`height` and `width`) then `padding` then `border` lastly the `margin`. Additionally, the relationship of how position, display and float effects the layout of the overall webpage. This interactivity exposed a weakspot on my understanding of CSS3. My goal is to learn and understand how these properities interact with each other. Lastly, we focused on responsive design and the grid layout. These concepts are connected because depending on which device a vistor is on, as a developer, it is imperative to make the grid render properly for that viewport.
