#Outline



In week 6, we reviewed chessboards and reviewed topics that were blockers. I enjoyed working on the weekend assignment. I choose a blog a layout that was challenging to recreate. I still want to go back and refactor some of my code from previous assignments. Overall, good vibes.Lastly, last week marked a hard earned 6 week milestone during this cohort.



* excitement for the coming weeks -- pitch and demo day.
