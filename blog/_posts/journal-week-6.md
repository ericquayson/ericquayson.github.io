#Journal 6


In week 6, we reviewed chessboards and topics that were blockers in the earlier weeks of the program. I enjoyed working on the weekend assignment. I decided to work on a blog that was challenging to recreate. I still want to go back and refactor some of my code from previous assignments. It's hard to believe that 6 weeks have already passed.  I've already started to research companies I would like to work for.
